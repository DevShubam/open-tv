I've been developing and maintaining this project alone and for entirely for free over the past 2 years. I am in dire need of support to continue developing this project. I've never added annoying donation pop-ups or anything of the sort to make sure you have the fastest and cleanest IPTV experience and I'm committed to keep this project FREE & OPEN-SOURCE. To keep that commitment, I need your support!

## Features:
- Import your IPTV channels from any source (M3U File, M3U link, Xtream) üóÉÔ∏è
- Record while watching üé•
- Multi IPTV sources üéä
- Control the UI from a TV remote üì∫
- Super low RAM usage, crazy speeds, and instant search üöÖ
- Refresh your sources when you need it üîÑ
- Add channels to favorites üåü

## Prerequisites
If you are on Windows or use the flatpak on Linux; SKIP THIS PART. 

The app depends on mpv, ffmpeg and yt-dlp. 
If you are on MacOS, you must use Brew or MacPorts to install those dependencies. 

On Fedora, you must add rpmfusion to install those packages.

On Debian or LTS distro, I would strongly suggest using a backport for yt-dlp.

The Windows build **comes with mpv included** (.msi), but you can still install mpv from a package manager of your choice to always have the latest version installed

```
brew install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #MacOS
sudo dnf install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #Fedora
sudo zypper install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #OpenSUSE
sudo pacman -Syu mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #Arch
sudo apt install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #Debian/Ubuntu
scoop install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp # Windows
choco install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp # Windows alternative
```

If you have a tv remote or air mouse that has slightly different bindings for general nav (back, up, down, left, right),
please open an issue and I will add them if it's feasible. Otherwise, you can still use hwdb to make them match OpenTV's bindings.

## Settings explained

**Stream Caching**

Why enabling:
  - If you have a slow internet connection/IPTV provider causing the stream to pause often

Why disabling: 
  - If the stream often drops completely. It will prevent the stream from jumping too far ahead/behind
  - If you have a good internet/provider and want lower latency
  - Can prevent some weird bugs/slowdowns
